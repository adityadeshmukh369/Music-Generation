# Music-Generation

In this musical generation process, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is used as the underlying model to generate music in the ABC notation format. First, the musical sequence data in the form of ABC notation is preprocessed and encoded as a sequence of unique numerical values that can be understood by the LSTM model. The encoded musical sequences are then organized into batches, where each batch consists of several musical sequences.

The LSTM model is trained on these batches of numerical musical sequences using backpropagation through time, which involves updating the weights of the network based on the error between the predicted and actual output. During the training process, the LSTM model learns to predict the next note or chord in the sequence based on the previous notes or chords.

Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to generate new music by feeding it a sequence of starting notes or chords and then iteratively predicting the next note or chord based on the previous predictions.
